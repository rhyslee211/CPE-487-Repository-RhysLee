# LED Decoder

For this part of the lab I copied a LED decoder given by Professor Lu.

I took three images of the working program on the board given to us.

The first is with switches 15, 14 and 0 set to on. ![](https://github.com/rhyspiecesno8/CPE-487-Repository-RhysLee/blob/main/Lab1/leddec1.jpg)

The second is with switches 0, 1, 2, 3 and 14 set to on. ![](https://github.com/rhyspiecesno8/CPE-487-Repository-RhysLee/blob/main/Lab1/leddec2.jpg)

The third is with switches 0, 1, and 2 set to on. ![](https://github.com/rhyspiecesno8/CPE-487-Repository-RhysLee/blob/main/Lab1/leddec3.jpg)
