## Lab1

# LED Decoder

For this part of the lab I copied a LED decoder given by Professor Lu.

I took three images of the working program on the board given to us.

The ![first](https://github.com/rhyspiecesno8/CPE-487-Repository-RhysLee/blob/main/Lab1/leddec1.jpg) is with switches 15, 14 and 0 set to on.

The ![second](https://github.com/rhyspiecesno8/CPE-487-Repository-RhysLee/blob/main/Lab1/leddec2.jpg) is with switches 0, 1, 2, 3 and 14 set to on.

The ![third](https://github.com/rhyspiecesno8/CPE-487-Repository-RhysLee/blob/main/Lab1/leddec3.jpg) is with switches 0, 1, and 2 set to on.

# Hex Counter

For this part of the lab I copied a hex counter given by Professor Lu.

This ![recording](https://youtu.be/GfroP71qs-o) shows the working hex counter on the Nexys A7-100T board.
