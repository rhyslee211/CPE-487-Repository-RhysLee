## Lab 2

# Four Digit Hex Counter

For lab 2 we initially copied files for a four digit hex counter and attempted to create a memory configuration file to allow the Nexys A7-100T board
to boot these files from memory after start up.

# Eight Digit Hex Counter

Next in lab 2 we copied files for an eight digit hex counter and attempted to replace the memory configuartion file so that the board would instead boot up an eight digit hex counter
