# Hex Calculator

Lab 4 was to compile and run code for a hex calculator and an improved hex calculator. The original hex calculator allowed you to input up to four digits and add numbers inputted together. The user used a keypad to input digits 0 through F, and BTNU as an Addition symbol, and BTNL as an equals symbol. BTNC was used as a clear button to replace all digits with a zero.

# Modified Hex Calculator

The modified hex calculator was able to stop leading zeroes from appearing on the FPGA display. If you entered 49 into the original hex calculator, it would display 0049, but on the modified it would display 49. It also allowed subtraction of two numbers as well as the addition in the original hex calculator.
