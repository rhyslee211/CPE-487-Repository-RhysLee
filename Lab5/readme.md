## Lab 5

# Siren

Lab 5 was to compile and run a set of code that would make a siren noise on an audio output device. In the original design the pitch of the siren only raises and lowers as time passes.

[Here is a video of the original siren](https://youtu.be/ja69aQtkG78) (The volume of the siren is low so you may need to raise your volume to hear it)

# Modified Siren

The siren was then modified by allowing the user to change the tone module to create a square wave, rather than triangle wave when BTNU is pressed. Also the wailing speed of the siren was able to be changed by using switches 0 through 7 on the board.
