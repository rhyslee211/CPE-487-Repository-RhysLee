## Labs 3 and 6

# Lab 3: Bouncing Ball

Lab 3 was to compile and run code for a bouncing ball. Initially in the unmodified code the ball is actually a square and just bounces straight up and down. In the modified code the ball is an actual circle and bounces around the screen with motion in both the x and y directions.

# Lab 6: Pong Game

Lab 6 was to compile and run code to make a single player pong game. The ball moves in the x and y direction and bounces off all edges except the bottom, which it passes straight through. The paddle is controlled using the BTNR and BTNL buttons to move right and left, respectively. Alternate code also allowed a potentiometer to be used to move the paddle but it was not used by me in this lab. The modified pong game allowed the user to change the ball speed using the switches, as well as modify the color of the ball in the code. The bat also starts initially longer but then gets shorter as the player gets more hits on the ball. It also counts the number of hits on the ball. The first modified pong game video shows a fast yellow ball, and the second shows a slow purple ball.
